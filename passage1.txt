Meanwhile, you hear the whirl and roar of the crowd 
in the vortex of life around you; 
you hear,
you see, men living in reality; 
you see that life for them is not forbidden, that
their life does not float away like a dream, like a vision; 
that their life is being
eternally renewed, eternally youthful, 
and not one hour of it is the same as another; 
while fancy is so spiritless, monotonous to vulgarity and easily scared,
the slave of shadows, of the idea, 
the slave of the first cloud that shrouds the sun,
and overcasts with depression the true Petersburg heart so devoted to the sun,
and what is fancy in depression!
