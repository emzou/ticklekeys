Meanwhile, you hear the whirl and roar of the crowd in the vortex of life around you; you hear,
you see, men living in reality; you see that life for them is not forbidden, that
their life does not float away like a dream, like a vision; that their life is being
eternally renewed, eternally youthful, and not one hour of it is the same as
another; while fancy is so spiritless, monotonous to vulgarity and easily scared,
the slave of shadows, of the idea, the slave of the first cloud that shrouds the sun,
and overcasts with depression the true Petersburg heart so devoted to the sunâ€”
and what is fancy in depression! One feels that this inexhaustible fancy is weary
at last and worn out with continual exercise, because one is growing into
manhood, outgrowing one's old ideals: they are being shattered into fragments,
into dust; if there is no other life one must build one up from the fragments. And
meanwhile the soul longs and craves for something else! And in vain the
dreamer rakes over his old dreams, as though seeking a spark among the embers,
to fan them into flame, to warm his chilled heart by the rekindled fire, and to
rouse up in it again all that was so sweet, that touched his heart, that set his
blood boiling, drew tears from his eyes, and so luxuriously deceived him!
