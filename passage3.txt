The perfect political state is, by its nature, man‟s species-life, as opposed to his material life. All
the preconditions of this egoistic life continue to exist in civil society1 outside the sphere of the
state, but as qualities of civil society. Where the political state has attained its true development,
man – not only in thought, in consciousness, but in reality, in life – leads a twofold life, a
heavenly and an earthly life: life in the political community, in which he considers himself a
communal being, and life in civil society, in which he acts as a private individual, regards other
men as a means, degrades himself into a means, and becomes the plaything of alien powers. The
relation of the political state to civil society is just as spiritual as the relations of heaven to earth.
The political state stands in the same opposition to civil society, and it prevails over the latter in
the same way as religion prevails over the narrowness of the secular world – i.e., by likewise
having always to acknowledge it, to restore it, and allow itself to be dominated by it. In his most
immediate reality, in civil society, man is a secular being. Here, where he regards himself as a
real individual, and is so regarded by others, he is a fictitious phenomenon. In the state, on the
other hand, where man is regarded as a species-being, he is the imaginary member of an illusory
sovereignty, is deprived of his real individual life and endowed with an unreal universality.
