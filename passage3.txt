The political state stands in the same opposition to civil society, and it prevails over the latter in
the same way as religion prevails over the narrowness of the secular world â€“ i.e., by likewise
having always to acknowledge it, to restore it, and allow itself to be dominated by it. In his most
immediate reality, in civil society, man is a secular being. Here, where he regards himself as a
real individual, and is so regarded by others, he is a fictitious phenomenon. In the state, on the
other hand, where man is regarded as a species-being, he is the imaginary member of an illusory
sovereignty, is deprived of his real individual life and endowed with an unreal universality.
